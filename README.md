## UX

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

## Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) to build rudimentary wireframes for a basic understanding.
I have made frames for desktop, tablet and mobile:
- [Wireframe for Desktop](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Paradise/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-desktop.pdf)
- [Wireframe for Tablet](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Paradise/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-tablet.pdf)
- [Wireframe for Mobile](https://github.com/Carina-P/Skiers-Paradise/blob/master/assets/wireframes/wireframe-mobile.pdf)

### Major changes compared to above wireframes

## Design Choices
### Fonts
I have choosen **Varela**, because i find it **modern** and stylish but also **clean** and easy to read. "Because it is extremely clean and minimalistic in design, it is able to sit well in body text at small sizes, 
or be used for headlines and menu items." (quote from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Varela#standard-styles). And as the alternative: Montserrat.
### Icons

### Colors
I want the colors to match a day in the skiing slope: White for **snow**, light-blue for the **sky** and yellow for the **sun**. 
<img src="assets/wireframes/colors-skiers-paradise.png" width="75%">

## Testing
When it has been feasible the test where automated. The rest was tested manually. 
The manually testing was performed **regularly** in a **iterative** manner during the development of the site and then **thorough** after all features 
was in place. Testing often  and after a small part of development, makes it is **easier to find** and **fix bugs early** and it is also a way to **use experience** 
in coming development.

When all features was implemented the following tests was performed:
- Validated by [W3S Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/)
- Validated by [W3s CSS validation service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- According to the **scenarios** as described below
- The **deployed version** was tested
<!--In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
